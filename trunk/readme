!!! Caution !!!

This software and data set is intended for students as a way to experiment machine learning with weka and for researcher as a reproductible experiment
of DEFT 2013. THIS IS NOT SOMETHING EASY TO USE AND DEPLOY. You need machine learning, java and weka skills to use this package. We
can provide a litle help ... but not too much :-)

Enjoy

*** Folders description
Dont forget to add the path to your folder structure in the variables.vars class

DEFT2013/arff/		The ARFF files to reproduce experiments from gui or code (students can use those directly in weka gui with no further manipulations)
DEFT2013/corpus		The features lists (verbs, ngrams and so on) generated to build ARFF (you can regen thoses from software using classes of package "analyse")
DEFT2013/src		The Java code; use it to make stats, generate arff, generate full experiments, test with our (or new) models. You can use serialized models from Weka gui.
DEFT2013/models		Our models (Naive Bayes, LMT, SVM) generated with weka according to ARFF training files. Compliant with weka gui and the Java code
DEFT2013/run		The csv and results generated by our Java application and sent to DEFT2013 organisation as runs (final results of the paper)
DEFT2013/jar		The version 3-7-9 of weka jar is there for your convenience (GNU General Public License) . 

*** Try with Eclipse ***

1) Download and install weka 3-7-9
2) If you want to reproduce Svm experiment under eclipse

- Install LibBsvm from gui 

Tools/package manager => LibSVM

- Configure eclipse

To avoid classpath problems, please install from weka 3-7-9

From the Java project, under eclipse :

Make the classpath pointing on libraries :
- Right button on project, properties
- Java build path
- add external class folder : on folder /home/yourname/wekafiles/packages/LibSVM (exists if you used weka 3-7-9)
- add external jar /home/yourname/wekafiles/packages/LibSVM.jar

Dont forget to import weka.jar from 3-7-9. 

*** Use the Weka Gui and explorer

- Please launch Weka with enough memory to test on ARFF files :

java -Xmx2048m -jar weka.jar

- You can use ARFF files from ARFF folder to make experiments

Same results as the Wikimeta Lab system for DEFT2013 will be obtained with same classifiers (see paper http://goo.gl/vSVBU) and a 5 fold experiment.
